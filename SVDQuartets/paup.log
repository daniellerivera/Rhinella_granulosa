Data read in DNA format

Data matrix has 46 taxa, 7667 characters
Valid character-state symbols: ACGT
Missing data identified by 'N'
Gaps identified by '-'
"Equate" macros in effect:
   R,r ==> {AG}
   Y,y ==> {CT}
   M,m ==> {AC}
   K,k ==> {GT}
   S,s ==> {CG}
   W,w ==> {AT}
   H,h ==> {ACT}
   B,b ==> {CGT}
   V,v ==> {ACG}
   D,d ==> {AGT}

Outgroup status changed:
  1 taxon transferred to outgroup
  Total number of taxa now in outgroup = 1
  Number of ingroup taxa = 45

Analysis using SVDQuartets method

  Number of taxa (lineages) in the analysis = 46
  Tips assigned to species using taxon partition 'species'
  Quartet sampling = exhaustive (30459 quartets)
  Doing standard bootstrap analysis
    Initial bootstrap seed = generated automatically
    Number of bootstrap replicates = 100
  Tree model = multispecies coalescent (expected rank of flattening matrix for true tree = 10)
  Using 2 parallel threads on 8 processors
  Tree search:
    Quartet assembly algorithm = QFM
    Local search = none

Quartet assembly completed:
  Total weight of incompatible quartets = 4.9714 (14.204%)
  Total weight of compatible quartets   = 30.0286 (85.796%)
  Time used for QFM = 0.00 sec (CPU time = 0.00 sec)
